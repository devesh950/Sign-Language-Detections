🎯 HOW TO GET ACCURATE SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTION
===============================================================================

✅ IMPROVEMENTS MADE:
   • Increased confidence threshold to 80% (was 70%)
   • Better hand tracking (min confidence 70%)
   • Faster processing (every 2nd frame instead of 3rd)
   • Smoother detection buffer (5 frames instead of 8)
   • Shows "uncertain" for 60-79% confidence

===============================================================================
📖 HOW TO MAKE GESTURES FOR ACCURATE DETECTION:
===============================================================================

1. LIGHTING:
   ✓ Make sure you have good lighting
   ✓ Face a window or light source
   ✓ Avoid backlighting (don't sit in front of bright window)

2. HAND POSITION:
   ✓ Keep hand 30-60cm (1-2 feet) from camera
   ✓ Show your FULL HAND in the frame
   ✓ Keep hand centered in the camera view
   ✓ Don't cover fingers with other fingers

3. BACKGROUND:
   ✓ Use plain background (not cluttered)
   ✓ Avoid similar colors to your skin tone
   ✓ Keep other people/hands out of frame

4. GESTURE TIPS:
   ✓ Make CLEAR, DISTINCT gestures
   ✓ Hold the gesture STEADY for 1-2 seconds
   ✓ Don't move hand too fast
   ✓ Keep fingers spread clearly (don't bunch them)

5. TESTING:
   ✓ Try letter "A" first (fist with thumb on side)
   ✓ Try number "5" (all fingers spread)
   ✓ Watch the confidence score (should be >80%)

⚙️ CONFIDENCE LEVELS:
===============================================================================

   • 80-100% = ✅ ACCURATE - Voice speaks, shown in green
   • 60-79%  = ⚠️ UNCERTAIN - Shown but voice silent
   • 0-59%   = ❌ TOO LOW - "No clear sign detected"

===============================================================================
🔧 IF STILL INACCURATE:
===============================================================================

1. Improve lighting (most common issue!)
2. Clean your camera lens
3. Make sure you're using the correct gesture
4. Hold gesture steady and clear
5. Check that your full hand is visible
6. Try moving closer/further from camera

===============================================================================
📚 REMEMBER: The model was trained on specific gestures!
    
    • 26 letters: A-Z (American Sign Language alphabet)
    • 10 numbers: 0-9 (ASL numbers)
    • 1 space gesture

    Make sure you're doing the gesture EXACTLY as trained!
